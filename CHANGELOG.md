## 0.4.2

**BREAKING**

**Fixes**

- added new Marker Widget to easily create new Markers(you can use it where ever Summon can be used)
- added `Entity.Marker` selector that selects all markers with an optional data field

- changed dependencies (removed meta and changed colorize to ansicolor)
- fixed Area generating NULL instead of 0 by default
- fixed triggering hotreload if only properties on project changed and refactored mechanics

You need at least Dart 1.12 for this version of objD and most likely have to migrate to null safety yourself (which is easy with the provided tools: https://dart.dev/go/null-safety-migration)

After doing so, ensure your version constaint is set to this to ensure all features are active:

```yaml
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.12.0 <3.0.0"
```
